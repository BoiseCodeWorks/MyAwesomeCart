Fork and open the link above.

###Getting Started
In this project you have been provided with a basic shoping cart that is capable
of adding items from a store and calculating the total cost of any items added 
to the cart. However you will notice the site is broken because of some missing
items. 

###Step 1 - Creating the Store Object
You have been tasked with creating the store object. Open store.js and create an
variable called store and set it equal to an object. Give the store object two
properties one called name and the other called items.

###Step 2 - Adding Items
The items property in the store object will be a list of objects (AKA an Array).
Each item in the store should have the following properties. 

```javascript
name: String
colors: Array of Objects
sizes: Array of Strings
price: Number
img: String(*hint a url)
```

As you are working you will automagically see your store populating to the view.
We will cover how this is working at a later point for now simply enjoy it.

###Step 3 - Save Locally
Once you have added your items download your plunk add it to this repo and push 
it to your github account.
